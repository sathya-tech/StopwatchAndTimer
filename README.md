## Acknowledgments
The Stopwatch App is a simple project developed for educational purposes. It uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional stopwatch with lap recording and reset functionality.

## Note:
1. The app uses the "alert.mp3" file for the notification sound when a timer reaches zero. Ensure that the audio file is present in the same directory as the HTML files.
2. The app uses the "localStorage" to save and manage timers. The timers will be stored locally in the browser. Clearing browser data or using incognito mode may result in data loss.

Feel free to explore, use, and modify the code according to your needs. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please let me know!

Enjoy using the Stopwatch App!
